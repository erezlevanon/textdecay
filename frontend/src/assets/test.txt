Description:

What if digital files were made to degrade?

Data ages differently than materials in the natural world, so much so that it is thought not to degrade over time.
Digital media needs energy; because digital files don't degrade, they constantly consume energy. It might not seem like a big deal, but when observing this phenomenon from a broad perspective, much energy is consumed in this endless process — so much so that storage facilities worldwide already surpass the airline industry [for example] in producing carbon emissions.

Imagine if data could decay. What profound effect would this have on digital media? Will it change how we—the owners, producers, and users of digital media — care for or value our digital belongings?

This prototype is designed to test, explore and speculate on how digital text files might decay over time. [As you’ve probably noticed] The text you are reading now is not static; it adapts and changes based on your interaction, the time you spend with it, and the number of readers engaged with it over time.
When left unattended, it will gradually fade; fragments will begin to vanish, information will become less understandable, and the file size will shrink until it consumes the least energy possible.

This prototype seeks to highlight the realities of excessive digital production and consumption and the pressing consequences of digital permanence. With this prototype, we invite you [the reader] to actively participate in its care and help us understand whether it justifies the energy it consumes.
